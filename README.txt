This is the NEA programming project for AQA GCSE Computer Science
You are free to copy code from this project and use in your own
work as long as you credit me in a comment next to the piece(s) of
code you have used from my project. This may be irrelevant to your
project if you are currently doing GCSE Computer Science because
the project changes every year but you can copy the concepts or 
parts of code that you need to use !!! Enjoy !!!


IMPORTANT!

Create a blank notepad in the same directory/folder as 
the project and name it as follows:

OutputRLE.txt

you do not need to type .txt as it should add it automatically
i could not upload this file to github as it is a blank file
until the program writes to it.
